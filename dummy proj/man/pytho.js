/*Write some code to calculate the hypotenuse of a triangle using the Pythagorean
theorem when given the values of the other two sides. The theorem specifies that the
relation between the sides of a right-angled triangle is a2 + b2 = c2.
You can use prompt() to get the value for a and b. Write code to get the value from
the user for a and b. Then square the values of both a and b before adding them
together and finding the square root. Print your answer to the console.*/
